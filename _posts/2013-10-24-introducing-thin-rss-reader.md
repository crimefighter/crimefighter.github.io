A few years ago I grew dissatisfied with Google Reader and started looking for an alternative. I tried a lot of different apps but never found a perfect one. None of them allowed me to focus on reading and dive into long texts as well as navigate and filter my stream easily.

It seems like a lot of people did the same thing, enough to get Google Reader shut down. I started wondering how many of these people found what they wanted and how should a perfect RSS reader look like. I learned that there are currently two common approaches to RSS.

First is to treat it like e-mail. This is rather old approach and it may seem obsolete, but a majority of modern RSS readers are still following it. They are designed to give you a big picture of your inbox and your folders. There is a lot of navigation and chrome to help you filter your inbox quickly and unread counts constantly remind you that you may be missing something important. All these things distract you and obstruct your reading experience.

A more modern approach is to treat RSS like a magazine. Apps that provide a personalized digital magazine, like Flipboard and Zite, are very popular on tablets and cellphones. These apps focus on content presentation and provide much better reading experience.

A magazine may or may not be a good source of information, but it is a very good medium to learn from. Here's why:

* A magazine doesn't have the table of contents printed on each page. In a good magazine content always takes 100% of the page. Nothing to interrupt your reading experience.
* A magazine is continuous experience. When you finish an article, you just flip the page and go to another. You don't have to go to the table of contents each time to get to the next article.
* A magazine is easy to navigate. You can easily skip articles or go to any specific article.
* Navigation is invisible until it's needed. You can't accidently jump articles or bring up the table of contents while reading a magazine by, say, putting your finger on it. You have to turn pages to do that.

But do these apps really provide this experience on a digital medium? Let's have a look at them:

The problem is that they only reproduce visual features of a magazine, the most notable of them being multi column layout. But it doesn't work well on a digital medium, even if it's a tablet, so they have to cut corners. They are only displaying previews instead of full articles, so you have to tap one to read the article and then go back to previews to pick another one. This is not something you do with a magazine. Continuous reading experience is gone and navigation becomes less obvious and involves multiple levels.

So instead of trying to mimic a paper magazine on a digital medium, I focused on reproducing things that are most important for my experience with it. The result is a minimalistic RSS reader designed to present you a continuous stream of your updates in a comfortable to read way and minimize distractions. 100% of the page is dedicated to give content space to breathe and shine. It is called Thin RSS Reader.

Thin Reader is a mix of the two approaches to RSS. It has all the features needed to organize your sources and filter your content stream, but this functionality is designed to stay away until it's needed. The app is currently in the alpha stage, but it is already capable of being your RSS reader. I will greatly appreciate if you give it a try and share any thoughts on it. Was it able to change your experience with RSS? Did it help you concentrate on long texts? Please use the comments form or e-mail to [contact@thinrssreader.com](mailto:contact@thinrssreader.com).
