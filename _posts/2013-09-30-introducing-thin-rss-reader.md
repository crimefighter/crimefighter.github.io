Thin is a minimalistic RSS reader designed to help you concentrate on reading by taking distractions away.

Many people consider RSS obsolete today, because it is too hard to use. And they are right. But of course, RSS itself is just a format, which has proven its usefulness and surely isn't going anywhere. The idea of RSS reader is very simple too: you provide links to websites you want to read, then read updates from all of them in a single feed. People have no problem understanding this concept on Twitter and Facebook. So what't making RSS so hard?

RSS was always considered a geeky thing. Ten years ago it was mostly used by people who consumed way more information than average internet user. So RSS readers traditionally have advanced capabilities for managing sources and filtering the information stream. It is also a tradition to put this functionality in front of reading experience. Information was more valuable back then and people were much more motivated to read it, so painfully small font and uncomfortable reading space were considered normal.

Today we're all used to consuming a lot of information, and we know it doesn't have to be a geeky thing. We changed the way we consume information. Vast amounts of information made every piece of it disposable. We don't care if we miss something anymore, because important things will reach us anyway. The way information is presented is now playing a huge role, because today we are much less motivated to read it. This is where RSS readers lose. Small text tightly packed into a box doesn't look like something worth reading, and the interface designed to help you not miss anything now does everything to steal your focus. You end up feeling like there's nothing worth reading anymore and start looking for a replacement to RSS.

No wonder people switch to tools that provide better results, like Twitter and Reddit. Reason these apps work better may be because they force you to follow the link and open actual article, so your further experience is up to content providers. And if they are smart enough, they will help you read the whole piece and feel like you didn't waste your time. Only when you feel like you're done, you return to the list of links, which is hidden away until this moment, and get another link. All these steps are clearly separated and transitions between them require very obvious intent, so you can't accidently switch your attention to something irrelevant while you read. These transitions happen in a familliar context of a browser window, which makes the whole thing even easier to understand and use.

Can RSS experience be improved to match? In Thin I tried to bring the old RSS reader experience to a modern time by focusing on reading experience and keeping everything else under the hood. Thin Reader is designed to present you a feed of your updates in a way that is comfortable to read. The content is right at the center of the screen and not shifted to the right, and there are no toolbars or sidebars hanging on the way. Everything else is redesigned to stay out of your sight until it's needed. Minimalistic interface lets text catch your attention from the start and helps you maintain focus by minimizing distractions.

It made a huge difference for me. When you are given back the ability to read something, you may rediscover RSS as useful tool.

Thin Reader is a fully standalone and independent app powered by its own RSS engine. It provides all the features necessary for organizing and working with your feeds.

Thin Reader is currently in alpha stage, but it's already capable of being your RSS reader. It will be significantly improved over time and new features will be added, but it will always be a simple app with focus on distraction free reading experience. I hope it will convince you to give RSS another chance and look forward to hear about your experience.
